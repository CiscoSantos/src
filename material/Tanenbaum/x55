on a word basis, possibly even a byte basis. Imagine splitting each byte of the single virtual disk into a pair of 4-bit nibbles, then adding a Hamming code to each
one to form a 7-bit word, of which bits 1, 2, and 4 were parity bits. Further imagine that the seven drives of Fig. 2-23(c) were synchronized in terms of arm position
and rotational position. Then it would be possible to write the 7-bit Hamming
coded word over the seven drives, one bit per drive.
The Thinking Machines CM-2 computer used this scheme, taking 32-bit data
words and adding 6 parity bits to form a 38-bit Hamming word, plus an extra bit
for word parity, and spread each word over 39 disk drives. The total throughput
