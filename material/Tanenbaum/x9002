convert to NAND form, the lines connecting the output of the AND gates to the input
of the OR gate should be redrawn with two inversion bubbles, as shown in
Fig. 3-8(c). Finally, using Fig. 3-7(a), we arrive at Fig. 3-8(d). The variables A
and B can be generated from A and B using NAND or NOR gates with their inputs
tied together. Note that inversion bubbles can be moved along a line at will, for example, from the outputs of the input gates in Fig. 3-8(d) to the inputs of the output
gate.
As a final note on circuit equivalence, we will now demonstrate the surprising
result that the same physical gate can compute different functions, depending on
the conventions used. In Fig. 3-9(a) we show the output of a certain gate, F, for
different input combinations. Both inputs and outputs are shown in volts. If we

adopt negative logic, which has 0 volts as logical 1 and 1.5 volts as logical 0, we
get the truth table of Fig. 3-9(c), the OR function.
