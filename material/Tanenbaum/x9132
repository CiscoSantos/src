Figure 5-6. The Core i7 numeric data types. Supported types are marked with ×.
Types marked with ‘‘64-bit’’ are only supported in 64-bit mode.

The Core i7 is also good at manipulating 8-bit ASCII characters: there are special instructions for copying and searching character strings. These instructions
can be used both with strings whose length is known in advance and with strings
whose end is marked. They are often used in string manipulation libraries.

DATA TYPES

5.2.4 Data Types on the OMAP4430 ARM CPU
The OMAP4430 ARM CPU supports a wide range of data formats, as shown
in Fig. 5-7. For integers alone, it can support 8-, 16-, and 32-bit operands, both
signed and unsigned. The handling of small data types in the OMAP4430 is slightly more clever than in the Core i7. Internally, the OMAP4430 is 32-bit machine
with 32-bit datapaths and instructions. For loads and stores, the program can specify the size and sign of the value to be loaded (e.g., load signed byte: LDRSB). The
value is then converted by load instructions into a comparable 32-bit value. Similarly, stores also specify the size and sign of the value to write to memory, and they
access only the specified portion of the input register.
Signed integers use two’s complement. Floating-point operands of 32 and 64
bits are included and conform to the IEEE 754 standard. Binary coded decimal
numbers are not supported. All operands must be aligned in memory. Character
and string data types are not supported by special hardware instructions. They are
manipulated entirely in software.

5.2.5 Data Types on the ATmega168 AVR CPU
The ATmega168 has a very limited number of data types. With one exception,
all the registers are 8 bits wide, so integers are also 8 bits wide. Characters are also
