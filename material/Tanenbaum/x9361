If a number is given as a command, then that number of instructions is executed.
The number k is equivalent to typing a return k times. The same effect is achieved
if the number is followed by an exclamation mark, !, or an X.

The command g can be used to go to a certain line in the source file. There are
three versions of this command. If it is preceded by a line number, then the tracer
executes until that line is encountered. With a label /T, with or without +#, the line
number at which to stop is computed from the instruction label T. The g command, without any indication preceding it, causes the tracer to execute commands
until the current line number is again encountered.
