majority of its inputs are 0 and 1 if a majority of its inputs are 1. Although any
Boolean function can be fully specified by giving its truth table, as the number of
variables increases, this notation becomes increasingly cumbersome. Instead, another notation is frequently used.

To see how this other notation comes about, note that any Boolean function
can be specified by telling which combinations of input variables give an output
value of 1. For the function of Fig. 3-3(a) there are four combinations of input
variables that make M equal to 1. By convention, we will place a bar over an input

variable to indicate that its value is inverted. The absence of a bar means that it is
not inverted. Furthermore, we will use implied multiplication or a dot to mean the
Boolean AND function and + to mean the Boolean OR function. Thus, for example, ABC takes the value 1 only when A = 1 and B = 0 and C = 1. Also,
AB + BC is 1 only when ( A = 1 and B = 0) or (B = 1 and C = 0). The four rows
of Fig. 3-3(a) producing 1 bits in the output are: ABC, ABC, ABC, and ABC. The
function, M, is true (i.e., 1) if any of these four conditions is true, so we can write
