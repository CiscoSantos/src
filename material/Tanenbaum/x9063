Figure 4-5. The microinstruction format for the Mic-1 (to be described shortly).

At this point we can control the data path with 9 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 24 signals,
hence 24 bits. However, these 24 bits control the data path for only one cycle. The
second part of the control is to determine what is done on the following cycle. To
include this in the design of the controller, we will create a format for describing
the operations to be performed using the 24 control bits plus two additional fields:
NEXT ADDRESS and JAM. Their contents will be discussed shortly. Figure 4-5
shows a possible format, divided into the six groups (listed below the instruction)
and containing the following 36 signals:

Addr – Contains the address of a potential next microinstruction.
JAM
