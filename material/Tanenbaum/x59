the same linear velocity at the head. A constant-linear-velocity drive is quite different than a magnetic-disk drive, which operates at a constant angular velocity, independent of where the head is currently positioned. Also, 530 RPM is a far cry
from the 3600 to 7200 RPM that most magnetic disks whirl at.
In 1984, Philips and Sony realized the potential for using CDs to store computer data, so they published the Yellow Book defining a precise standard for what
are now called CD-ROMs (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory). To piggyback
on the by-then already substantial audio CD market, CD-ROMs were to be the
same physical size as audio CDs, mechanically and optically compatible with
them, and produced using the same polycarbonate injection molding machines.
The consequences of this decision were that slow variable-speed motors were required, but also that the manufacturing cost of a CD-ROM would be well under
one dollar in moderate volume.
What the Yellow Book defined was the formatting of the computer data. It
also improved the error-correcting abilities of the system, an essential step because
although music lovers do not mind losing a bit here and there, computer lovers
tend to be Very Picky about that. The basic format of a CD-ROM consists of encoding every byte in a 14-bit symbol. As we saw above, 14 bits is enough to Hamming encode an 8-bit byte with 2 bits left over. In fact, a more powerful encoding
system is used. The 14-to-8 mapping for reading is done in hardware by table
lookup.
At the next level up, a group of 42 consecutive symbols forms a 588-bit frame.
Each frame holds 192 data bits (24 bytes). The remaining 396 bits are for error
correction and control. This scheme is identical for audio CDs and CD-ROMs.

What the Yellow Book adds is the grouping of 98 frames into a CD-ROM sector, as shown in Fig. 2-26. Every CD-ROM sector begins with a 16-byte preamble, the first 12 of which are 00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00 (hexadecimal), to
allow the player to recognize the start of a CD-ROM sector. The next 3 bytes contain the sector number, needed because seeking on a CD-ROM with its single data
spiral is much more difficult than on a magnetic disk with its uniform concentric
tracks. To seek, the software in the drive calculates approximately where to go,
moves the head there, and then starts hunting around for a preamble to see how
good its guess was. The last byte of the preamble is the mode.

The Yellow Book defines two modes. Mode 1 uses the layout of Fig. 2-26,
with a 16-byte preamble, 2048 data bytes, and a 288-byte error-correcting code (a
cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon code). Mode 2 combines the data and ECC fields
into a 2336-byte data field for those applications that do not need (or cannot afford
the time to perform) error correction, such as audio and video. Note that to provide excellent reliability, three separate error-correcting schemes are used: within a
symbol, within a frame, and within a CD-ROM sector. Single-bit errors are corrected at the lowest level, short burst errors are corrected at the frame level, and
any residual errors are caught at the sector level. The price paid for this reliability
is that it takes 98 frames of 588 bits (7203 bytes) to carry a single 2048-byte payload, an efficiency of only 28 percent.
Single-speed CD-ROM drives operate at 75 sectors/sec, which gives a data rate
of 153,600 bytes/sec in mode 1 and 175,200 bytes/sec in mode 2. Double-speed
drives are twice as fast, and so on up to the highest speed. A standard audio CD
has room for 74 minutes of music, which, if used for mode 1 data, gives a capacity
of 681,984,000 bytes. This figure is usually reported as 650 MB because 1 MB is
220 bytes (1,048,576 bytes), not 1,000,000 bytes.
As usual, whenever a new technology comes out, some people try to push the
envelope. When designing the CD-ROM, Philips and Sony were cautious and had
the writing process stop well before the outer edge of the disc was reached. It did

not take long before some drive manufacturers allowed their drives to go beyond
the official limit and come perilously close to the physical edge of the medium,
giving about 700 MB instead of 650 MB. But as the technology improved and the
blank discs were manufactured to a higher standard, 703.12 MB (360,000
2048-byte sectors instead of 333,000 sectors) became the new norm.
Note that even a 32x CD-ROM drive (4,915,200 bytes/sec) is no match for a
fast SCSI-2 magnetic-disk drive at 10 MB/sec. When you realize that the seek
time is often several hundred milliseconds, it should be clear that CD-ROM drives
