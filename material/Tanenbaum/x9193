Figure 6-9. Comparison of paging and segmentation.

The contents of a page are, in a sense, accidental. The programmer is unaware
that paging is even occurring. Although putting a few bits in each entry of the
page table to specify the access allowed would be possible, to utilize this feature
the programmer would have to keep track of where in his address space the page
boundaries were. The trouble with this idea is that this is precisely the sort of
administration that paging was invented to eliminate. Because the user of a segmented memory has the illusion that all segments are in main memory all the time,
they can be addressed without having to be concerned with the administration of
overlaying them.

6.1.7 Implementation of Segmentation
Segmentation can be implemented in one of two ways: swapping and paging.
In the former scheme, some set of segments is in memory at a given instant. If a
reference is made to a segment not currently in memory, that segment is brought
in. If there is no room for it, one or more segments must be written to disk first
(unless a clean copy already exists there, in which case the memory copy can just
be abandoned). In a certain sense, segment swapping is not unlike demand paging:
segments come and segments go as needed.
However, the implementation of segmentation differs from paging in a very essential way: pages are of fixed size and segments are not. Figure 6-10(a) shows an
example of physical memory initially containing five segments. Now consider
what happens if segment 1 is evicted and segment 7, which is smaller, is put in its
place. We arrive at the memory configuration of Fig. 6-10(b). Between segment 7
and segment 2 is an unused areaâ€”that is, a hole. Then segment 4 is replaced by
segment 5, as shown in Fig. 6-10(c), and segment 3 is replaced by segment 6, as in

VIRTUAL MEMORY

Fig. 6-10(d). After the system has been running for a while, memory will be divided up into a number of chunks, some containing segments and some containing
holes. This phenomenon is called external fragmentation (because space is
wasted external to the segments, in the holes between them). Sometimes external
fragmentation is called checkerboarding.
