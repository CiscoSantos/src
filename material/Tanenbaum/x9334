Figure B-2. The approximate lower and upper bounds of expressible (unnormalized) floating-point decimal numbers.

A variation of this representation is used in computers. For efficiency, exponentiation is to base 2, 4, 8, or 16 rather than 10, in which case the fraction consists
of a string of binary, base-4, octal, or hexadecimal digits. If the leftmost of these
digits is zero, all the digits can be shifted one place to the left and the exponent
decreased by 1, without changing the value of the number (barring underflow). A
fraction with a nonzero leftmost digit is said to be normalized.
Normalized numbers are generally preferable to unnormalized numbers, because there is only one normalized form, whereas there are many unnormalized
forms. Examples of normalized floating-point numbers are given in Fig. B-3 for
