well. In effect, Leibniz had built the equivalent of a four-function pocket calculator three centuries ago.
Nothing much happened for the next 150 years until a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, Charles Babbage (1792–1871), the inventor of

the speedometer, designed and built his difference engine. This mechanical device, which like Pascal’s could only add and subtract, was designed to compute
tables of numbers useful for naval navigation. The entire construction of the machine was designed to run a single algorithm, the method of finite differences using
polynomials. The most interesting feature of the difference engine was its output
method: it punched its results into a copper engraver’s plate with a steel die, thus
foreshadowing later write-once media such as punched cards and CD-ROMs.
Although the difference engine worked reasonably well, Babbage quickly got
bored with a machine that could run only one algorithm. He began to spend increasingly large amounts of his time and family fortune (not to mention 17,000
pounds of the government’s money) on the design and construction of a successor
called the analytical engine. The analytical engine had four components: the store
(memory), the mill (computation unit), the input section (punched-card reader),
and the output section (punched and printed output). The store consisted of 1000
words of 50 decimal digits, each used to hold variables and results. The mill could
accept operands from the store, then add, subtract, multiply, or divide them, and finally return the result to the store. Like the difference engine, it was entirely mechanical.
