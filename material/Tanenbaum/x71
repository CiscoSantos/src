possible for each pixel, so no halftoning is needed. Small snapshot printers often
use the dye sublimation process to produce highly realistic photographic images on
special (and expensive) paper.
Finally, we come to the thermal printer, which contains a small print head
with some number of tiny heatable needles on it. When an electric current is passed through a needle, it gets very hot very fast. When a special thermally sensitive
paper is pulled past the print head, dots are made on the paper when the needles are
hot. In effect, a thermal printer is like the old matrix printers whose pins pressed
against a typewriter ribbon to make dots on the paper behind the ribbon. Thermal
printers are widely used to print receipts in stores, ATM machines, automated gas
stations, etc.

2.4.6 Telecommunications Equipment
Most computers nowadays are connected to a computer network, often the Internet. Achieving this access requires special equipment. In this section we will
see how this equipment works.
Modems
With the growth of computer usage in the past years, it is common for one
computer to need to communicate with another computer. For example, many people have personal computers at home that they use for communicating with their
computer at work, with an Internet Service Provider, or with a home banking system. In many cases, the telephone line provides the physical communication.
However, a raw telephone line (or cable) is not suitable for transmitting computer signals, which generally represent a 0 as 0 volts and a 1 as 3 to 5 volts as
shown in Fig. 2-38(a). Two-level signals suffer considerable distortion when transmitted over a voice-grade telephone line, thereby leading to transmission errors. A

pure sine-wave signal at a frequency of 1000 to 2000 Hz, called a carrier, can be
transmitted with relatively little distortion, however, and this fact is exploited as the
basis of most telecommunication systems.

Because the pulsations of a sine wave are completely predictable, a pure sine
wave transmits no information at all. However, by varying the amplitude, frequency, or phase, a sequence of 1s and 0s can be transmitted, as shown in Fig. 2-38.
This process is called modulation and the device that does it is called a modem,
which stands for MOdulator DEModulator. In amplitude modulation [see
Fig. 2-38(b)], two different voltage levels are used, for 0 and 1, respectively. A
person listening to digital data transmitted at a very low data rate would hear a loud
noise for a 1 and no noise for a 0.
In frequency modulation [see Fig. 2-38(c)], the voltage level is constant but
the carrier frequency is different for 1 and 0. A person listening to frequency modulated digital data would hear two tones, corresponding to 0 and 1. Frequency
modulation is often referred to as frequency shift keying.
In simple phase modulation [see Fig. 2-38(d)], the amplitude and frequency
do not change, but the phase of the carrier is reversed 180 degrees when the data
