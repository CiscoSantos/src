a × (b − c) = a × b − a × c
Let us evaluate both sides for a = 5, b = 210, c = 195. The left-hand side is
5 × 15, which yields 75. The right-hand side is not 75 because a × b overflows.
Judging from these examples, one might conclude that although computers are
general-purpose devices, their finite nature renders them especially unsuitable for
doing arithmetic. This conclusion is, of course, not true, but it does serve to illustrate the importance of understanding how computers work and what limitations
they have.

A.2 RADIX NUMBER SYSTEMS
An ordinary decimal number with which everyone is familiar consists of a
string of decimal digits and, possibly, a decimal point. The general form and its
usual interpretation are shown in Fig. A-1. The choice of 10 as the base for exponentiation, called the radix, is made because we are using decimal, or base 10,
numbers. When dealing with computers, it is frequently convenient to use radices
other than 10. The most important radices are 2, 8, and 16. The number systems
based on these radices are called binary, octal, and hexadecimal, respectively.

A radix k number system requires k different symbols to represent the digits 0
to k − 1. Decimal numbers are built up from the 10 decimal digits

In contrast, binary numbers do not use these ten digits. They are all constructed
exclusively from the two binary digits
01
Octal numbers are built up from the eight octal digits
01234567
For hexadecimal numbers, 16 digits are needed. Thus six new symbols are required. It is conventional to use the uppercase letters A through F for the six digits
following 9. Hexadecimal numbers are then built up from the digits

The expression ‘‘binary digit’’ meaning a 1 or a 0 is usually referred to as a bit.
Figure A-2 shows the decimal number 2001 expressed in binary, octal, decimal,
and hexadecimal form. The number 7B9 is obviously hexadecimal, because the
symbol B can only occur in hexadecimal numbers. However, the number 111
might be in any of the four number systems discussed. To avoid ambiguity, people
use a subscript of 2, 8, 10, or 16 to indicate the radix when it is not obvious from
the context.
