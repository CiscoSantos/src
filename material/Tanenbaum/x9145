Figure 5-21. Decision table used by the infix-to-reverse Polish notation algorithm

After each action is taken, a new comparison is made between the car currently
at the switch, which may be the same car as in the previous comparison or may be
the next car, and the car that is now the last one on the Texas line. The process
continues until step 4 is reached. Notice that the Texas line is being used as a
stack, with routing a car to Texas being a push operation, and turning a car already
on the Texas line around and sending it to California being a pop operation.
