5.5.10 The ATmega168 AVR Instructions
The ATmega168 has a simple instruction set, shown in Fig. 5-35. Each line
gives the mnemonic, a brief description, and a snippet of pseudocode that details
the operation of the instruction. As is to be expected, there are a variety of MOV instructions for moving data between the registers. There are instructions for pushing and popping from a stack, which is pointed to by the 16-bit stack pointer (SP)
in memory. Memory can be accessed with either an immediate address, register
indirect, or register indirect plus a displacement. To allow up to 64 KB of addressing, the load with an immediate address is a 32-bit instruction. The indirect
addressing modes utilize the X, Y, and Z register pairs, which combine two 8-bit
registers to form a single 16-bit pointer.
The ATmega168 has simple arithmetic instructions for adding, subtracting, and
multiplying, the latter of which use two registers. Incrementing and decrementing
are also possible and commonly used. Boolean, shift, and rotate instructions are
also present. The branch and call instruction can target an immediate address, a
PC-relative address, or an address contained in the Z register pair.

5.5.11 Comparison of Instruction Sets
The three example instruction sets are very different. The Core i7 is a classic
two-address 32-bit CISC machine, with a long history, peculiar and highly irregular addressing modes, and many instructions that reference memory.
