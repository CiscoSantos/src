this configuration, if either input is high, the corresponding transistor will turn on
and pull the output down to ground. If both inputs are low, the output will remain
high.
These three circuits, or their equivalents, form the three simplest gates. They
are called NOT, NAND, and NOR gates, respectively. NOT gates are often called
inverters; we will use the two terms interchangeably. If we now adopt the convention that ‘‘high’’ (V cc volts) is a logical 1, and that ‘‘low’’ (ground) is a logical 0,
we can express the output value as a function of the input values. The symbols
used to depict these three gates are shown in Fig. 3-2(a)–(c), along with the functional behavior for each circuit. In these figures, A and B are inputs and X is the
output. Each row specifies the output for a different combination of the inputs.
