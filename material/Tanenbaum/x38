processor. The next instruction from each thread then executes on up to 16 SIMD
processors, although possibly fewer if there is not enough data parallelism. If each
thread is able to perform 16 operations per cycle, a fully loaded Fermi GPU core
with 32 SMs will perform a whopping 512 operations per cycle. This is an impressive feat considering that a similar-sized general purpose quad-core CPU would
struggle to achieve 1/32 as much processing.
A vector processor appears to the programmer very much like a SIMD processor. Like a SIMD processor, it is very efficient at executing a sequence of operations on pairs of data elements. But unlike a SIMD processor, all of the operations
are performed in a single, heavily pipelined functional unit. The company Seymour Cray founded, Cray Research, produced many vector processors, starting
with the Cray-1 back in 1974 and continuing through current models.
Both SIMD processors and vector processors work on arrays of data. Both execute single instructions that, for example, add the elements together pairwise for
two vectors. But while the SIMD processor does it by having as many adders as
elements in the vector, the vector processor has the concept of a vector register,
