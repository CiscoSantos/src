Computer Networks, 5th ed.
This widely read classic, with a fifth edition co-authored with David Wetherall, provides the
ideal introduction to today’s and tomorrow’s networks. It explains in detail how modern networks are
structured. Starting with the physical layer and working up to the application layer, the book covers a
vast number of important topics, including wireless communication, fiber optics, data link protocols,
Ethernet, routing algorithms, network performance, security, DNS, electronic mail, the World Wide
Web, and multimedia. The book has especially thorough coverage of TCP/IP and the Internet.

Modern Operating Systems, 3rd ed.
This worldwide best-seller incorporates the latest developments in operating systems. The book
starts with chapters on the principles, including processes, memory management, file systems, I/O,
and so on. Then it goes into three chapter-long case studies: Linux, Windows, and Symbian. Tanenbaum’s experience as the designer of three operating systems (Amoeba, Globe, and MINIX) gives
him a background few other authors can match, so the final chapter distills his long experience into
advice for operating system designers.

Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, 3rd ed.
All other textbooks on operating systems are long on theory and short on practice. This one is
different. In addition to the usual material on processes, memory management, file systems, I/O, and
so on, it contains a CD-ROM with the source code (in C) of a small, but complete, POSIX-conformant operating system called MINIX 3 (see www.minix3.org). All the principles are illustrated by
showing how they apply to MINIX 3. The reader can also compile, test, and experiment with MINIX
3, leading to in-depth knowledge of how an operating system really works.

Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms, 2nd ed.
Distributed systems are becoming ever-more important in the world and this book explains their
principles and illustrates them with numerous examples. Among the topics covered are architectures,
processes, communication, naming, synchronization, consistency, fault tolerance, and security. Examples are taken from distributed object-based, file, Web-based, and coordination-based systems.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
Andrew S. Tanenbaum has an S.B. degree from M.I.T. and a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. He is currently a Professor of Computer Science at the Vrije
Universiteit where he has taught operating systems, networks, and related topics for over 30
years. His current research is on highly reliable operating systems although he has worked
on compilers, distributed systems, security, and other topics over the years. These research
projects have led to over 150 refereed papers in journals and conferences.
Prof. Tanenbaum has also (co)authored five books which have now appeared in 19 editions. The books have been translated into 21 languages, ranging from Basque to Thai and
are used at universities all over the world. In all, there are 159 versions (language/edition
combinations). See at www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/book covers for images of them.
Prof. Tanenbaum has also produced a considerable volume of software, including the
