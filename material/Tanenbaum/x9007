Adders
A computer that cannot add integers is almost unthinkable. Consequently, a
hardware circuit for performing addition is an essential part of every CPU. The
truth table for addition of 1-bit integers is shown in Fig. 3-16(a). Two outputs are
present: the sum of the inputs, A and B, and the carry to the next (leftward) position. A circuit for computing both the sum bit and the carry bit is illustrated in
Fig. 3-16(b). This simple circuit is generally known as a half adder.

BASIC DIGITAL LOGIC CIRCUITS

Although a half adder is adequate for summing the low-order bits of two multibit input words, it will not do for a bit position in the middle of the word because it
does not handle the carry into the position from the right. Instead, the full adder
of Fig. 3-17 is needed. From inspection of the circuit it should be clear that a full
adder is built up from two half adders. The Sum output line is 1 if an odd number
of A, B, and the Carry in are 1. The Carry out is 1 if either A and B are both 1 (left
input to the OR gate) or exactly one of them is 1 and the Carry in bit is also 1. Together the two half adders generate both the sum and the carry bits.
