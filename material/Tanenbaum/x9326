For example,
10110 = 24 + 22 + 21 = 16 + 4 + 2 = 22
In the other method, the binary number is written vertically, one bit per line, with
the leftmost bit on the bottom. The bottom line is called line 1, the one above it
line 2, and so on. The decimal number will be built up in a parallel column next to
the binary number. Begin by writing a 1 on line 1. The entry on line n consists of
two times the entry on line n − 1 plus the bit on line n (either 0 or 1). The entry on
the top line is the answer. Figure A-6 gives an example of this method of binary to
decimal conversion.

Figure A-5. Conversion of the decimal number 1492 to binary by successive
halving, starting at the top and working downward. For example, 93 divided by 2
yields a quotient of 46 and a remainder of 1, written on the line below it.

Decimal-to-octal and decimal-to-hexadecimal conversion can be accomplished
either by first converting to binary and then to the desired system or by subtracting
powers of 8 or 16.

A.4 NEGATIVE BINARY NUMBERS
Four different systems for representing negative numbers have been used in
digital computers at one time or another in history. The first one is called signed
magnitude. In this system the leftmost bit is the sign bit (0 is + and 1 is −) and the
remaining bits hold the absolute magnitude of the number.
The second system, called one’s complement, also has a sign bit with 0 used
for plus and 1 for minus. To negate a number, replace each 1 by a 0 and each 0 by
a 1. This holds for the sign bit as well. One’s complement is obsolete.
The third system, called two’s complement, also has a sign bit that is 0 for
plus and 1 for minus. Negating a number is a two-step process. First, each 1 is replaced by a 0 and each 0 by a 1, just as in one’s complement. Second, 1 is added
