with n inverted inputs).
Using the identities of Fig. 3-7 and the analogous ones for multi-input gates, it
is easy to convert the sum-of-products representation of a truth table to pure NAND
or pure NOR form. As an example, consider the EXCLUSIVE OR function of
Fig. 3-8(a). The standard sum-of-products circuit is shown in Fig. 3-8(b). To

(AB)C = A(BC)

(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)

Distributive law

A + BC = (A + B)(A + C)

A(B + C) = AB + AC

Absorption law

A(A + B) = A

A + AB = A

De Morgan's law
