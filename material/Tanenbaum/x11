market for computers was about four or five units. Instead, DEC mostly sold small
circuit boards to companies to integrate into their products.
When the PDP-1 finally appeared in 1961, it had 4096 18-bit words of core
memory and could execute 200,000 instructions/sec. This performance was half
that of the IBM 7090, the transistorized successor to the 709, and the fastest computer in the world at the time. The PDP-1 cost $120,000; the 7090 cost millions.
DEC sold dozens of PDP-1s, and the minicomputer industry was born.
One of the first PDP-1s was given to M.I.T., where it quickly attracted the
attention of some of the budding young geniuses so common at M.I.T. One of the
PDP-1’s many innovations was a visual display and the ability to plot points anywhere on its 512-by-512 pixel screen. Before long, the students had programmed
the PDP-1 to play Spacewar, and the world had its first video game.
A few years later DEC introduced the PDP-8, which was a 12-bit machine, but
much cheaper than the PDP-1 ($16,000). The PDP-8 had a major innovation: a
single bus, the omnibus, as shown in Fig. 1-6. A bus is a collection of parallel
wires used to connect the components of a computer. This architecture was a
major departure from the memory-centered IAS machine and has been adopted by
nearly all small computers since. DEC eventually sold 50,000 PDP-8s, which established it as the leader in the minicomputer business.

Meanwhile, IBM’s reaction to the transistor was to build a transistorized version of the 709, the 7090, as mentioned above, and later the 7094. The 7094 had a
cycle time of 2 microsec and a core memory consisting of 32,768 words of 36 bits
each. The 7090 and 7094 marked the end of the ENIAC-type machines, but they
dominated scientific computing for years in the 1960s.
At the same time that IBM had become a major force in scientific computing
with the 7094, it was making a huge amount of money selling a little business-oriented machine called the 1401. This machine could read and write magnetic tapes,
read and punch cards, and print output almost as fast as the 7094, and at a fraction
of the price. It was terrible at scientific computing, but for business record keeping
it was perfect.
The 1401 was unusual in that it did not have any registers, or even a fixed word
length. Its memory was 4000 8-bit bytes, although later models supported up to a
then-astounding 16,000 bytes. Each byte contained a 6-bit character, an administrative bit, and a bit used to indicate end-of-word. A MOVE instruction, for example, had a source and a destination address and began moving bytes from the
source to the destination until it hit one with the end-of-word bit set to 1.

MILESTONES IN COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

In 1964 a tiny, unknown company, Control Data Corporation (CDC), introduced the 6600, a machine that was nearly an order of magnitude faster than the
mighty 7094 and every other machine in existence at the time. It was love at first
sight among the number crunchers, and CDC was launched on its way to success.
The secret to its speed, and the reason it was so much faster than the 7094, was that
inside the CPU was a highly parallel machine. It had several functional units for
doing addition, others for doing multiplication, and still another for division, and
all of them could run in parallel. Although getting the most out of it required careful programming, with some work it was possible to have 10 instructions being executed at once.
As if this was not enough, the 6600 had a number of little computers inside to
help it, sort of like Snow White and the Seven Vertically Challenged People. This
meant that the CPU could spend all its time crunching numbers, leaving all the details of job management and input/output to the smaller computers. In retrospect,
the 6600 was decades ahead of its time. Many of the key ideas found in modern
computers can be traced directly back to the 6600.
The designer of the 6600, Seymour Cray, was a legendary figure, in the same
league as Von Neumann. He devoted his entire life to building faster and faster
machines, now called supercomputers, including the 6600, 7600, and Cray-1. He
also invented a now-famous algorithm for buying cars: you go to the dealer closest
to your house, point to the car closest to the door, and say: ‘‘I’ll take that one.’’
This algorithm wastes the least time on unimportant things (like buying cars) to
leave you the maximum time for doing important things (like designing supercomputers).
There were many other computers in this era, but one stands out for quite a different reason and is worth mentioning: the Burroughs B5000. The designers of
machines like the PDP-1, 7094, and 6600 were all totally preoccupied with the
hardware, making it either cheap (DEC) or fast (IBM and CDC). Software was almost completely irrelevant. The B5000 designers took a different tack. They built
a machine specifically with the intention of having it programmed in Algol 60, a
forerunner of C and Java, and included many features in the hardware to ease the
compiler’s task. The idea that software also counted was born. Unfortunately it
was forgotten almost immediately.

1.2.4 The Third Generation—Integrated Circuits (1965–1980)
The invention of the silicon integrated circuit by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce
(working independently) in 1958 allowed dozens of transistors to be put on a single
chip. This packaging made it possible to build computers that were smaller, faster,
and cheaper than their transistorized predecessors. Some of the more significant
computers from this generation are described below.
By 1964 IBM was the leading computer company and had a big problem with
its two highly successful and profitable machines, the 7094 and the 1401: they

were as incompatible as two machines could be. One was a high-speed number
cruncher using parallel binary arithmetic on 36-bit registers, and the other was a
glorified input/output processor using serial decimal arithmetic on variable-length
words in memory. Many of its corporate customers had both and did not like the
