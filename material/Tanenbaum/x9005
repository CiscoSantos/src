Figure 3-11. An eight-input multiplexer circuit.

Using the multiplexer, we can implement the majority function of Fig. 3-3(a),
as shown in Fig. 3-12(b). For each combination of A, B, and C, one of the data
input lines is selected. Each input is wired to either V cc (logical 1) or ground (logical 0). The algorithm for wiring the inputs is simple: input Di is the same as the
value in row i of the truth table. In Fig. 3-3(a), rows 0, 1, 2, and 4 are 0, so the corresponding inputs are grounded; the remaining rows are 1, so they are wired to logical 1. In this manner any truth table of three variables can be implemented using
the chip of Fig. 3-12(a).
We just saw how a multiplexer chip can be used to select one of several inputs
and how it can implement a truth table. Another of its many applications is as a

parallel-to-serial data converter. By putting 8 bits of data on the input lines and
then stepping the control lines sequentially from 000 to 111 (binary), the 8 bits are
put onto the output line in series. A typical use for parallel-to-serial conversion is
in a keyboard, where each keystroke implicitly defines a 7- or 8-bit number that
must be output over a serial link, such as USB.
The inverse of a multiplexer is a demultiplexer, which routes its single input
signal to one of 2n outputs, depending on the values of the n control lines. If the
binary value on the control lines is k, output k is selected.
Decoders
As a second example, we will now look at a circuit that takes an n-bit number
as input and uses it to select (i.e., set to 1) exactly one of the 2n output lines. Such
a circuit, illustrated for n = 3 in Fig. 3-13, is called a decoder.
To see where a decoder might be useful, imagine a small memory consisting of
eight chips, each containing 256 MB. Chip 0 has addresses 0 to 256 MB, chip 1
has addresses 256 MB to 512 MB, and so on. When an address is presented to the
memory, the high-order 3 bits are used to select one of the eight chips. Using the
circuit of Fig. 3-13, these 3 bits are the three inputs, A, B, and C. Depending on
the inputs, exactly one of the eight output lines, D0 , . . . , D7 , is 1; the rest are 0.
Each output line enables one of the eight memory chips. Because only one output
line is set to 1, only one chip is enabled.
