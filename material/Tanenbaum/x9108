and one for the result, the same as the Mic-4. We will assume that if an instruction
is decoded in cycle n, execution starts in cycle n + 1. For a simple instruction,
such as an addition or subtraction, the writeback to the destination register occurs
at the end of cycle n + 2. For a more complicated instruction, such as a multiplication, the writeback occurs at the end of cycle n + 3. To make the example realistic,
we will allow the decode unit to issue up to two instructions per clock cycle. Commercial superscalar CPUs often can issue four or even six instructions per clock
cycle.
Our example execution sequence is shown in Fig. 4-43. Here the first column
gives the number of the cycle and the second one gives the instruction number.
The third column lists the instruction decoded. The fourth one tells which instruction is being issued (with a maximum of two per clock cycle). The fifth one tells
which instruction has been retired (completed). Remember that in this example we
are requiring both in-order issue and in-order completion, so instruction k + 1 cannot be issued until instruction k has been issued, and instruction k + 1 cannot be
retired (meaning the writeback to the destination register is performed) until instruction k has been retired. The other 16 columns are discussed below.
After decoding an instruction, the decode unit has to decide whether or not it
can be issued immediately. To make this decision, the decode unit needs to know
the status of all the registers. If, for example, the current instruction needs a register whose value has not yet been computed, the current instruction cannot be issued
and the CPU must stall.
We will keep track of register use with a device called a scoreboard, which
was first present in the CDC 6600. The scoreboard has a small counter for each
register telling how many times that register is in use as a source by currently executing instructions. If a maximum of, say, 15 instructions may be executing at
once, then a 4-bit counter will do. When an instruction is issued, the scoreboard
entries for its operand registers are incremented. When an instruction is retired,
the entries are decremented.
The scoreboard also has counters to keep track of registers being used as destinations. Since only one write at a time is allowed, these counters can be 1-bit
wide. The rightmost 16 columns in Fig. 4-43 show the scoreboard.
