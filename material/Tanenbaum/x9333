underflow error. Underflow error is less serious than overflow error, because 0 is
often a satisfactory approximation to numbers in regions 3 and 5. A bank balance
of 10−102 dollars is hardly better than a bank balance of 0.
Another important difference between floating-point numbers and real numbers is their density. Between any two real numbers, x and y, is another real number, no matter how close x is to y. This property comes from the fact that for any
distinct real numbers, x and y, z = (x + y)/2 is a real number between them. The
real numbers form a continuum.
Floating-point numbers, in contrast, do not form a continuum. Exactly
179,100 positive numbers can be expressed in the five-digit, two-sign system used
above, 179,100 negative numbers, and 0 (which can be expressed in many ways),
for a total of 358,201 numbers. Of the infinite number of real numbers between
−10+100 and +0. 999 × 1099 , only 358,201 of them can be specified by this notation.
They are symbolized by the dots in Fig. B-1. It is quite possible for the result of a
calculation to be one of the other numbers, even though it is in region 2 or 6. For
example, +0. 100 × 103 divided by 3 cannot be expressed exactly in our system of
representation. If the result of a calculation cannot be expressed in the number
representation being used, the obvious thing to do is to use the nearest number that
can be expressed. This process is called rounding.
The spacing between adjacent expressible numbers is not constant throughout
region 2 or 6. The separation between +0. 998 × 1099 and +0. 999 × 1099 is vastly
more than the separation between +0. 998 × 100 and +0. 999 × 100 . However, when
the separation between a number and its successor is expressed as a percentage of
that number, there is no systematic variation throughout region 2 or 6. In other
words, the relative error introduced by rounding is approximately the same for
small numbers as large numbers.
Although the preceding discussion was in terms of a representation system
with a three-digit fraction and a two-digit exponent, the conclusions drawn are
valid for other representation systems as well. Changing the number of digits in
the fraction or exponent merely shifts the boundaries of regions 2 and 6 and
changes the number of expressible points in them. Increasing the number of digits
in the fraction increases the density of points and therefore improves the accuracy

of approximations. Increasing the number of digits in the exponent increases the
size of regions 2 and 6 by shrinking regions 1, 3, 5, and 7. Figure B-2 shows the
approximate boundaries of region 6 for floating-point decimal numbers for various
sizes of fraction and exponent.
