The registers in the first group, AX, BX, CX, and DX are the general registers.
The first register of this group, AX, is called the accumulator register. It is used
to collect results of computations and is the target of many of the instructions.
Although each of the registers can perform a host of tasks, in some instructions this
AX is the implied destination, for example, in multiplication.
The second register of this group is BX, the base register. For many purposes
BX can be used in the same way as AX, but it has one power AX does not have. It is
