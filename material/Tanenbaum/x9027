down before the CPU strobes it in. The combination of constraints on T AD and T DS
means that, in the worst case, the memory will have only 25 − 4 − 2 = 19 nsec
from the time the address appears until it must produce the data. Because 10 nsec
is enough, even in the worst case, a 10-nsec memory can always respond during
T 3 . A 20-nsec memory, however, would just miss and have to insert a second wait
state and respond during T 4 .
