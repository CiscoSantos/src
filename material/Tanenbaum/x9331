Figure A-9. Addition in one’s complement and two’s complement.

If the addend and the augend are of opposite signs, overflow error cannot occur. If they are of the same sign and the result is of the opposite sign, overflow
error has occurred and the answer is wrong. In both one’s and two’s complement
arithmetic, overflow occurs if and only if the carry into the sign bit differs from the
carry out of the sign bit. Most computers preserve the carry out of the sign bit, but
the carry into the sign bit is not visible from the answer. For this reason, a special
overflow bit is usually provided.

PROBLEMS

PROBLEMS
1. Convert the following numbers to binary: 1984, 4000, 8192.
2. What is 1001101001 (binary) in decimal? In octal? In hexadecimal?
3. Which of the following are valid hexadecimal numbers? BED, CAB, DEAD,
DECADE, ACCEDED, BAG, DAD.
4. Express the decimal number 100 in all radices from 2 to 9.
5. How many different positive integers can be expressed in k digits using radix r numbers?
6. Most people can only count to 10 on their fingers; however, computer scientists can do
better. If you regard each finger as one binary bit, with finger extended as 1 and finger
touching palm as 0, how high can you count using both hands? With both hands and
both feet? Now use both hands and both feet, with the big toe on your left foot as a
sign bit for two’s complement numbers. What is the range of expressible numbers?
7. Perform the following calculations on 8-bit two’s complement numbers.
00101101
+ 01101111

11111111
+ 11111111

00000000
− 11111111

11110111
− 11110111

8. Repeat the calculation of the preceding problem but now in one’s complement.
9. Consider the following addition problems for 3-bit binary numbers in two’s complement. For each sum, state
a. Whether the sign bit of the result is 1.
b. Whether the low-order 3 bits are 0.
c. Whether an overflow occurred.

10. Signed decimal numbers consisting of n digits can be represented in n + 1 digits without a sign. Positive numbers have 0 as the leftmost digit. Negative numbers are
formed by subtracting each digit from 9. Thus the negative of 014725 is 985274.
Such numbers are called nine’s complement numbers and are analogous to one’s complement binary numbers. Express the following as three-digit nine’s complement numbers: 6, −2, 100, −14, −1, 0.
11. Determine the rule for addition of nine’s complement numbers and then perform the
following additions.
0001
+ 9999

0001
+ 9998

9997
+ 9996

9241
+ 0802

12. Ten’s complement is analogous to two’s complement. A ten’s complement negative
number is formed by adding 1 to the corresponding nine’s complement number, ignoring the carry. What is the rule for ten’s complement addition?
