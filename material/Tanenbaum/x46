This theoretical lower limit can be achieved using a method due to Richard
Hamming (1950). Before taking a look at Hammingâ€™s algorithm, let us look at a
simple graphical representation that clearly illustrates the idea of an error-correcting code for 4-bit words. The Venn diagram of Fig. 2-14(a) contains three circles, A, B, and C, which together form seven regions. As an example, let us encode
the 4-bit memory word 1100 in the regions AB, ABC, AC, and BC, 1 bit per region
(in alphabetical order). This encoding is shown in Fig. 2-14(a).
