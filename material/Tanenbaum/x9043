PCI Bus Operation
Like all PC buses going back to the original IBM PC, the PCI bus is synchronous. All transactions on the PCI bus are between a master, officially called
the initiator, and a slave, officially called the target. To keep the PCI pin count

down, the address and data lines are multiplexed. In this way, only 64 pins are
needed on PCI cards for address plus data signals, even though PCI supports 64-bit
addresses and 64-bit data.
The multiplexed address and data pins work as follows. On a read operation,
during cycle 1, the master puts the address onto the bus. On cycle 2, the master removes the address and the bus is turned around so the slave can use it. On cycle 3,
the slave outputs the data requested. On write operations, the bus does not have to
be turned around because the master puts on both the address and the data. Nevertheless, the minimum transaction is still three cycles. If the slave is not able to respond in three cycles, it can insert wait states. Block transfers of unlimited size are
also allowed, as well as several other kinds of bus cycles.
