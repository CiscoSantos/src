UMA Multiprocessors Using Multistage Switching Networks
That ‘‘something quite different’’ can be based on the humble 2 × 2 switch
shown in Fig. 8-30(a). This switch has two inputs and two outputs. Messages arriving on either input line can be switched to either output line. For our purposes
here, messages will contain up to four parts, as shown in Fig. 8-30(b). The Module
field tells which memory to use. The Address specifies an address within a module. The Opcode gives the operation, such as READ or WRITE. Finally, the optional Value field may contain an operand, such as a 32-bit word to be written on a
WRITE. The switch inspects the Module field and uses it to determine if the message should be sent on X or on Y.

Our 2 × 2 switches can be arranged in many ways to build larger multistage
switching networks. One option is the no-frills, economy class omega network,

SHARED-MEMORY MULTIPROCESSORS

illustrated in Fig. 8-31. Here we have connected eight CPUs to eight memories
using 12 switches. More generally, for n CPUs and n memories we would need
log2 n stages, with n/2 switches per stage, for a total of (n/2) log2 n switches,
which is a lot better than n2 crosspoints, especially for large values of n.
