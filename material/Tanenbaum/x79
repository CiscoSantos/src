Figure 2-44. The ASCII character set.

The idea behind Unicode is to assign every character and symbol a unique
16-bit value, called a code point. No multibyte characters or escape sequences are
used. Having every symbol be 16 bits makes writing software simpler.
With 16-bit symbols, Unicode has 65,536 code points. Since the world’s languages collectively use about 200,000 symbols, code points are a scarce resource
that must be allocated with great care. To speed the acceptance of Unicode, the
consortium cleverly used Latin-1 as code points 0 to 255, making conversion

between ASCII and Unicode easy. To avoid wasting code points, each diacritical
mark has its own code point. It is up to software to combine diacritical marks with
their neighbors to form new characters. While this puts more work on the software, it saves precious code points.
The code point space is divided up into blocks, each one a multiple of 16 code
