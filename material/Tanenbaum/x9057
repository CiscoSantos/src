outputs. The data path of our example microarchitecture is shown in Fig. 4-1.
While it has been carefully optimized for interpreting IJVM programs, it is fairly
similar to the data path used in most machines. It contains a number of 32-bit

registers, to which we have assigned symbolic names such as PC, SP, and MDR.
Though some of these names are familiar, it is important to understand that these
registers are accessible only at the microarchitecture level (by the microprogram).
They are given these names because they usually hold a value corresponding to the
variable of the same name in the ISA level architecture. Most registers can drive

their contents onto the B bus. The output of the ALU drives the shifter and then
the C bus, whose value can be written into one or more registers at the same time.
There is no A bus for the moment; we will add one later.
The ALU is identical to the one shown in Figs. 3-18 and 3-19. Its function is
determined by six control lines. The short diagonal line labeled ‘‘6’’ in Fig. 4-1 indicates that there are six ALU control lines. These are F0 and F1 for determining
the ALU operation, ENA and ENB for individually enabling the inputs, INVA for
inverting the left input, and INC for forcing a carry into the low-order bit, effectively adding 1 to the result. However, not all 64 combinations of ALU control
lines do something useful.
Some of the more interesting combinations are shown in Fig. 4-2. Not all of
these functions are needed for IJVM, but for the full JVM many of them would
come in handy. In many cases, there are multiple possibilities for achieving the
same result. In this table, + means arithmetic plus and − means arithmetic minus,
so, for example, − A means the two’s complement of A.
