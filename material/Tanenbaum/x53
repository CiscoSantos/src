2.3.4 SCSI Disks
SCSI disks are not different from IDE disks in terms of how their cylinders,
tracks, and sectors are organized, but they have a different interface and much
higher transfer rates. SCSI traces its history back to Howard Shugart, the inventor
of the floppy disk, which was used on the first personal computers in the 1980s.
His company introduced the SASI (Shugart Associates System Interface) disk in
1979. After some modification and quite a bit of discussion, ANSI standardized it
in 1986 and changed the name to SCSI (Small Computer System Interface).
SCSI is pronounced ‘‘scuzzy.’’ Since then, increasingly higher bandwidth versions

have been standardized under the names Fast SCSI (10 MHz), Ultra SCSI (20
MHz), Ultra2 SCSI (40 MHz), Ultra3 SCSI (80 MHz), Ultra4 SCSI (160 MHz),
and Ultra5 SCSI (320 MHz). Each of these has a wide (16-bit) version as well. In
fact, the recent ones have only a wide version. The main combinations are shown
in Fig. 2-22.
