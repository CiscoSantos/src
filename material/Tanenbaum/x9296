Figure 8-38. The BlueGene/P custom processor chip.

Three levels of cache are present on the chip. The first consists of a split L1
cache with 32 KB for instructions and 32 KB for data. The second is a unified
cache consisting of a unified 2-KB cache. The L2 caches are really prefetch buffers rather than true caches. They snoop on each other and are cache consistent.
The third level is a unified 4-MB shared cache that feeds data to the L2 caches.
The four processors share access to two 4-MB L3 cache modules. There is cache

coherency between the L1 caches on the four CPUs. Thus when a shared piece of
memory resides in more than one cache, accesses to that storage by one processor
will be immediately visible to the other three processors. A memory reference that
misses on the L1 cache but hits on the L2 cache takes about 11 clock cycles. A
miss on L2 that hits on L3 takes about 28 cycles. Finally, a miss on L3 that has to
go to the main DRAM takes about 75 cycles.
The four CPUs are connected via a high-bandwidth bus to a 3D torus network,
which requires six connections: up, down, north, south, east, and west. In addition,
each processor has a port to the collective network, used for broadcasting data to
all processors. The barrier port is used to speed up synchronization operations, giving each processor fast access to a specialized synchronization network.
At the next level up, IBM designed a custom card that holds one of the chips
shown in Fig. 8-38 along with 2 GB of DDR2 DRAM. The chip and the card are
shown in Fig. 8-39(a)â€“(b) respectively.
