A.3 CONVERSION FROM ONE RADIX TO ANOTHER
Conversion between octal or hexadecimal numbers and binary numbers is easy.
To convert a binary number to octal, divide it into groups of 3 bits, with the 3 bits
immediately to the left (or right) of the decimal point (often called a binary point)
forming one group, the 3 bits immediately to their left, another group, and so on.
Each group of 3 bits can be directly converted to a single octal digit, 0 to 7, according to the conversion given in the first lines of Fig. A-3. It may be necessary to add
one or two leading or trailing zeros to fill out a group to 3 full bits. Conversion
from octal to binary is equally trivial. Each octal digit is simply replaced by the equivalent 3-bit binary number. Conversion from hexadecimal to binary is just like

Figure A-4. Examples of octal-to-binary and hexadecimal-to-binary conversion.

Conversion of decimal numbers to binary can be done in two different ways.
The first method follows directly from the definition of binary numbers. The
largest power of 2 smaller than the number is subtracted from the number. The
process is then repeated on the difference. Once the number has been decomposed
into powers of 2, the binary number can be assembled with 1s in the bit positions
corresponding to powers of 2 used in the decomposition, and 0s elsewhere.
The other method (for integers only) consists of dividing the number by 2.
The quotient is written directly beneath the original number and the remainder, 0
or 1, is written next to the quotient. The quotient is then considered and the process repeated until the number 0 has been reached. The result of this process will be
two columns of numbers, the quotients and the remainders. The binary number
can now be read directly from the remainder column starting at the bottom. Figure
A-5 gives an example of decimal-to-binary conversion.
Binary integers can also be converted to decimal in two ways. One method
consists of summing up the powers of 2 corresponding to the 1 bits in the number.
