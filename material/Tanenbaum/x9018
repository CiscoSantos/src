being written rather than being read. Finally, the OE (Output Enable) signal is
asserted to drive the output signals. When it is not asserted, the chip output is
disconnected from the circuit.
In Fig. 3-30(b), a different addressing scheme is used. Internally, this chip is
organized as a 2048 × 2048 matrix of 1-bit cells, which gives 4 Mbits. To address
the chip, first a row is selected by putting its 11-bit number on the address pins.
Then the RAS (Row Address Strobe) is asserted. After that, a column number is
put on the address pins and CAS (Column Address Strobe) is asserted. The chip responds by accepting or outputting one data bit.
Large memory chips are often constructed as n × n matrices that are addressed
by row and column. This organization reduces the number of pins required but
also makes addressing the chip slower, since two addressing cycles are needed, one
for the row and one for the column. To win back some of the speed lost by this design, some memory chips can be given a row address followed by a sequence of
column addresses to access consecutive bits in a row.
Years ago, the largest memory chips were often organized like Fig. 3-30(b).
As memory words have grown from 8 bits to 32 bits and beyond, 1-bit-wide chips
began to be inconvenient. To build a memory with a 32-bit word from 4096K × 1
chips requires 32 chips in parallel. These 32 chips have a total capacity of at least
16 MB, whereas using 512K × 8 chips requires only four chips in parallel and allows memories as small as 2 MB. To avoid having 32 chips for memory, most chip
manufacturers now have chip families with 4-, 8-, and 16-bit widths. And the
situation with 64-bit words is even worse, of course.

THE DIGITAL LOGIC LEVEL

CHAP. 3

Two examples of 512-Mbit chips are given in Fig. 3-31. These chips have four
internal memory banks of 128 Mbit each, requiring two bank select lines to choose
a bank. The design of Fig. 3-31(a) is a 32M × 16 design, with 13 lines for the RAS
signal, 10 lines for the CAS signal, and 2 lines for the bank select. Together, these
25 signals allow each of the 225 internal 16-bit cells to be addressed. In contrast,
Fig. 3-31(b) is a 128M × 4 design, with 13 lines for the RAS signal, 12 lines for the
CAS signal, and 2 lines for the bank select. Here, 27 signals can select any of the
227 internal 4-bit cells to be addressed. The decision about how many rows and
how many columns a chip has is made for engineering reasons. The matrix need
not be square.
