The next three signals are for error reporting. The first of these is STOP#,
which the slave asserts if something disastrous happens and it wants to abort the
current transaction. The next one, PERR#, is used to report a data parity error on
the previous cycle. For a read, it is asserted by the master; for a write it is asserted
by the slave. It is up to the receiver to take the appropriate action. Finally, SERR#
is for reporting address errors and system errors.
