time increases. Make a reasonable guess about the ratio of the access time of optical
disk to that of register memory. Assume that the disk is already online.
7. Sociologists can get three possible answers to a typical survey question such as ‘‘Do
you believe in the tooth fairy?’’—namely, yes, no, and no opinion. With this in mind,
the Sociomagnetic Computer Company has decided to build a computer to process survey data. This computer has a trinary memory—that is, each byte (tryte?) consists of 8
trits, with a trit holding a 0, 1, or 2. How many trits are needed to hold a 6-bit number?
Give an expression for the number of trits needed to hold n bits.
8. Compute the data rate of the human eye using the following information. The visual
field consists of about 106 elements (pixels). Each pixel can be reduced to a superposition of the three primary colors, each of which has 64 intensities. The time resolution
is 100 msec.
9. Compute the data rate of the human ear from the following information. People can
hear frequencies up to 22 kHz. To capture all the information in a sound signal at 22
kHz, it is necessary to sample the sound at twice that frequency, that is, at 44 kHz. A
16-bit sample is probably enough to capture most of the auditory information (i.e., the
ear cannot distinguish more than 65,535 intensity levels).
10. Genetic information in all living things is coded as DNA molecules. A DNA molecule
is a linear sequence of the four basic nucleotides: A, C, G, and T. The human genome
contains approximately 3 × 109 nucleotides in the form of about 30,000 genes. What

is the total information capacity (in bits) of the human genome? What is the maximum
information capacity (in bits) of the average gene?
11. A certain computer can be equipped with 1,073,741,824 bytes of memory. Why would
a manufacturer choose such a peculiar number, instead of an easy-to-remember number like 1,000,000,000?
12. Devise a 7-bit even-parity Hamming code for the digits 0 to 9.
13. Devise a code for the digits 0 to 9 whose Hamming distance is 2.
14. In a Hamming code, some bits are ‘‘wasted’’ in the sense that they are used for checking and not information. What is the percentage of wasted bits for messages whose
total length (data + check bits) is 2n − 1? Evaluate this expression numerically for values of n from 3 to 10.
15. An extended ASCII character is represented by an 8-bit quantity. The associated Hamming encoding of each character can then be represented by a string of three hex digits.
Encode the following extended five-character ASCII text using an even-parity Hamming code: Earth. Show your answer as a string of hex digits.
16. The following string of hex digits encodes extended ASCII characters in an even-parity
Hamming code: 0D3 DD3 0F2 5C1 1C5 CE3. Decode this string and write down the
characters that are encoded.
17. The disk illustrated in Fig. 2-19 has 1024 sectors/track and a rotation rate of 7200
RPM. What is the sustained transfer rate of the disk over one track?
18. A computer has a bus with a 5-nsec cycle time, during which it can read or write a
32-bit word from memory. The computer has an Ultra4-SCSI disk that uses the bus
and runs at 160 Mbytes/sec. The CPU normally fetches and executes one 32-bit instruction every 1 nsec. How much does the disk slow down the CPU?
19. Imagine you are writing the disk-management part of an operating system. Logically,
you represent the disk as a sequence of blocks, from 0 on the inside to some maximum
on the outside. As files are created, you have to allocate free sectors. You could do it
from the outside in or the inside out. Does it matter which strategy you choose on a
modern disk? Explain your answer.
20. How long does it take to read a disk with 10,000 cylinders, each containing four tracks
of 2048 sectors? First, all the sectors of track 0 are to be read starting at sector 0, then
all the sectors of track 1 starting at sector 0, and so on. The rotation time is 10 msec,
and a seek takes 1 msec between adjacent cylinders and 20 msec for the worst case.
Switching between tracks of a cylinder can be done instantaneously.
21. RAID level 3 is able to correct single-bit errors using only one parity drive. What is
the point of RAID level 2? After all, it also can correct only one error and takes more
drives to do so.
22. What is the exact data capacity (in bytes) of a mode-2 CD-ROM containing the
now-standard 80-min media? What is the capacity for user data in mode 1?
23. To burn a CD-R, the laser must pulse on and off at a high speed. When running at 10x
speed in mode 1, what is the pulse length, in nanoseconds?

24. To be able to fit 133 minutes worth of video on a single-sided single-layer DVD, a fair
amount of compression is required. Calculate the compression factor required. Assume that 3.5 GB of space is available for the video track, that the image resolution is
720 × 480 pixels with 24-bit color (RGB at 8 bits each), and images are displayed at

the task of studying a being named Herb, an extra-terrestrial from Planet 10 who has
recently arrived here on Earth. Herb has given you the following information about
