1 - src/main/java: This is where your Java source code files reside. They should be placed according to their package structure.

2 - src/main/resources: This directory contains non-code resources such as configuration files, properties, or other assets that your application might need.
 
3 - lib/: Place your external libraries (JAR files like ODBC drivers, javax libraries, etc.) here.
 
4 - bin/: This is where your compiled class files will go.
 
5 - build/: This is where your final JAR file (if applicable) will be created after compilation.
